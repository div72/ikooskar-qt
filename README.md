# What is ikoOSKAR
ikoOSKAR (iko Ortak SÄ±nav Karma Sistemi) allows you to easily manage
your school's student placement schemes for exams. This program is especially
targeted for high schools.

With ikoOSKAR you can:

* Create student placement schemes with minimum same-grade student interaction
* Easily manage the student database
* // TODO

# ikoOSKAR-Qt
This project is a reimplementation of ikoOSKAR which was originally written in 
C# and .Net Framework

I used C++11 and Qt Framework 5.13 for this reimplementation, which makes the 
program cross-platform
and also more efficient

## Dependencies for development
* Qt Creator (optional but highly recommended)
* Qt Framework >= 5.13
* Compiler: GCC (for Linux), MinGW (for Windows)
  - I use [a script](/compile4win32.sh) that uses MXE (with 
  `i686-w64-mingw32.static-qmake-qt5` package) for cross-compiling to Windows
  - You won't need this if your host OS is Windows

## Dependencies for the end user
* Any program that can handle .xlsx files (e.g. MS Office, LibreOffice, WPS Office)
* Internet connection for the first activation

## Documentation
This project consists of 4 layers:

1. Data Access Layer (DAL for short): This is the layer which interacts with raw
 data; such as the database, the filesystem and the CloudAuth API
2. Business Logic Layer (BLL for short): This is the layer which contains the 
program logic and interacts between the UI and the DAL
3. User Interface Layer (UI for short) (aka Presentation Layer): This is the 
layer which handles all UI operations
4. Shared Layer (aka Entities): This layer contains shared classes and 
information across all the other layers
